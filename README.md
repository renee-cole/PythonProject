# The Vaccine Facility produces vaccines for a fixed population. The Flu vaccine is the sole vaccine in production at the beginning of simulation time. Then, a COVID vaccine is begins mass production at the facility. 
# The demand for the vaccine is 90% of the population as no one has been vaccinated yet (anti-vaxxers are remaining 10%). As supply increases, the people that get vaccinated are no longer a part of the demand. As demand decreases, the facility will move to produce both COVID and flu vaccines.

# Parameters may be changed as indicated to simulate different resource amounts and process times, and demand levels.
